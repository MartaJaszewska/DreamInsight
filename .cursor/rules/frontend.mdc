## Frontend

### General Guidelines

- Use React Server Components by default for performance.
- Use Client Components (`'use client'`) only when interactivity is necessary (e.g., event handlers, state, lifecycle effects).
- Place Client Components in separate files to keep Server Component bundles small.

### Guidelines for Styling

#### Tailwind

- Use the `@layer` directive to organize styles into components, utilities, and base layers.
- Use arbitrary values with square brackets (e.g., `w-[123px]`) for precise one-off designs.
- Implement the Tailwind configuration file for customizing theme, plugins, and variants.
- Leverage the `theme()` function in CSS for accessing Tailwind theme values.
- Implement dark mode with the `dark:` variant.
- Use responsive variants (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, etc.) for adaptive designs.
- Leverage state variants (`hover:`, `focus-visible:`, `active:`, etc.) for interactive elements.

### Guidelines for Accessibility

#### ARIA Best Practices

- Use ARIA landmarks to identify regions of the page (`<main>`, `<nav>`, etc.).
- Apply appropriate ARIA roles to custom interface elements that lack semantic HTML equivalents.
- Set `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` for expandable content like accordions and dropdowns.
- Use `aria-live` regions with appropriate politeness settings for dynamic content updates.
- Implement `aria-hidden` to hide decorative or duplicative content from screen readers.
- Apply `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` for elements without visible text labels.
- Use `aria-describedby` to associate descriptive text with form inputs or complex elements.
- Implement `aria-current` for indicating the current item in a set, navigation, or process.
- Avoid redundant ARIA that duplicates the semantics of native HTML elements.
